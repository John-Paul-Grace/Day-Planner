## Description

This app allows the user to add events to all of the hours of a typical business day. When the user presses the save button, the written events are set into local storage. This allows the events to persist between refreshes. The hours are also highlighted depending upon whether the hour is in the past, present, or future.

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Contributions

Some of the html and most of the css were provided. The javascript was written entirely by me. The Bootstrap, jQuery, and Moment.js libraries are used. Font Awesome and Google Fonts were used for the styling.
